Git Useful Commands:

The Three States

Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed:
	- Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your
	database yet.
	- Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into
	your next commit snapshot.
	- Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
	- You modify files in your working tree.
	- You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit,
	which adds only those changes to the staging area.
	- You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that
	snapshot permanently to your Git directory.
